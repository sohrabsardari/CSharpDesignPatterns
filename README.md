# Design Patterns implemented in C#

![BUILD](https://github.com/sohrabsardari/CSharp-design-patterns/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Introduction

**Design Patterns solve common problems by providing typical solutions that have consequences and have trade-offs.**



## Getting started

On this page, you can find several design patterns that are implemented in C#. It is recommended that you have some background knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and software design principles such as SOLID before reading about design patterns.



## Intent of this repository

When I was learning about design patterns, I couldn't find different examples of a design pattern in one place, so I had to search all over the internet. Therefore, I implement all of the design patterns I know so that others can use them as well. Hope you enjoy it!
